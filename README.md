# NavEco

NavEco is a web app which allows users to find their way in Paris within the RATP/SNCF network and the Velib one.
 We're also referencing lots of nice walks and cultural places based on your destination. 

Our goal is to push users to use public transports and bicycles over car and also to help them discover the city from another angle. 


## Getting Started
Here is our first version of the interface of the application.

### Break down into end to end tests

We want to test the accuracy of different types of algorithm with two different samples of data : 

- A sample that we created with 5 different metro lines which forms a directed graph. 

```
Test will be there 
```

- The second set of data that we will test is a sample of the real ratp network 

```
Test will be there 
```

### Test Results
